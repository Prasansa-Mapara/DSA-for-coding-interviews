Both pointers are now in the cycle. Consider two runners running in a cycle - the fast runner moves 2 steps while the slow runner moves 1 steps at a time. Since the speed difference is 1, it takes \dfrac{\text{distance between the 2 runners}}{\text{difference of speed}}
difference of speed
distance between the 2 runners
â€¢
loops for the fast runner to catch up with the slow runner. As the distance is at most "\text{cyclic length K}cyclic length K" and the speed difference is 1, we conclude that
\text{Number of iterations} = \text{almost}Number of iterations=almost "\text{cyclic length K}cyclic length K".
